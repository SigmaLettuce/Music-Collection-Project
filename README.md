  <summary>Getting sent to the menuscreen</summary>

  * Upon failing a command, it sends you back to the menuscreen. It was taking up too much of my time, I just wanted to make it work.

## How does it work?
* It's text-based. You have to write down commands with the quotation marks.

## I can't log out!
* That's a lowercase l. I had the users input autoconvert to lowercase for all the listings on the homepage, so I had to stick with it.
