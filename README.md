### CD Manager: Console Application

The CD Manager is a console-based application which is created to meet the specific needs of a user who owns a CD Collection. It is used as an inventory tracker, capable of containing data which is separated into categories of listings, requiring no setup aside from the insertion of their own data. Not only does the application track inventory, it also supports reviews that trusted individuals within a community of collectors can leave; though these reviews are based in the application itself that is offline, not an online forum as it is for personal use. These reviews do not support comments; rather the ability to leave ratings based on a tier system.
users can navigate through the application by entering listings provided on-screen.

Within the menuscreen, there are two types of boxes that act as identifiers for the listings shown. 
-	A box that contains a forward dash represents a directory; viewable data that can be identified by the name that follows the box.
-	A box that contains an asterisk represents a gear; or, settings. The settings of the application are very limited and are centralised around account management and user support.

It is important to note that this software is not cross-platform. Support for operating systems such as macOS, Linux and iOS are not natively supported at the moment.
